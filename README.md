# jenkinstest
testing jenkinspipelines

This code is for a very simple Jenkins and Selenium automated pipeline demo.

hello.html runs on a remote nginx web server.
PG1.java is the automated testing script that runs agains the hello.html webpage.

Both are very basic and bare minimum to illustrate Jenkins and Selenium in action.
